title: "Mitigating Representation Bias in Action Recognition: Algorithms and Benchmarks"
date: 2020-04-27 22:00:00 +0800
description: In this paper, we propose to mitigate the representation bias in action recognition via multi-aspect adversarial training as well as joint training with web media. We also propose new benchmarks to evaluate the bias mitigation effect, namely facet-based redistribution and out-of-distribution testing.
