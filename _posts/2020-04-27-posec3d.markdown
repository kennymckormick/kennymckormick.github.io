This post gives a brief introduction to the paper: [Revisiting Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13586), which provides a competitive alternative named **PoseC3D** to the popular GCN-based approaches. PoseC3D takes stacked 2D heatmaps as input and apply a 3D-CNN on top of them to recognize the action. The [codes](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2) and [predicted 2D skeleton annotations](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/master/tools/data/skeleton) we used are available.

# Abstract

Human skeleton, as a compact representation of human action, has received increasing attention in recent years. Many skeleton-based action recognition methods adopt graph convolutional networks (GCN) to extract features on top of human skeletons. Despite the positive results shown in previous works, GCN-based methods are subject to limitations in robustness, interoperability, and scalability. In this work, we propose PoseC3D, a new approach to skeleton-based action recognition, which relies on a 3D heatmap stack instead of a graph sequence as the base representation of human skeletons. Compared to GCN-based methods, PoseC3D is more effective in learning spatiotemporal features, more robust against pose estimation noises, and generalizes better in cross-dataset settings. Also, PoseC3D can handle multiple-person scenarios without additional computation cost, and its features can be easily integrated with other modalities at early fusion stages, which provides a great design space to further boost the performance. On four challenging datasets, PoseC3D consistently obtains superior performance, when used alone on skeletons and in combination with the RGB modality.

# The Drawback of GCN-based Approaches

<img src="/assets/img/posec3d/gcn.png" width="750px" class="center">

GCN-based methods are limited in the following aspects: 

1. Robustness: GCN directly handles coordinates of human joints, its recognition ability is significantly affected by the distribution shift of coordinates, which can often occur when applying a different pose estimator to acquire the coordinates. A small perturbation in coordinates often leads to completely different predictions. 
2. Interoperability: The graphical form of the skeleton representation makes it difficult to be fused with other modalities, especially in early or low-level stages, thus limiting the effectiveness of the combination. 
3. Scalability: GCN regards every human joint as a node, the complexity of GCN scales linearly with the number of persons, limiting its applicability to tasks that involve multiple persons, such as group activity recognition.
